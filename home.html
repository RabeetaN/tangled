        <h1>The Story</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Hundreds of years ago, a single drop of sunlight fell onto Earth and bloomed into a magical golden flower.
          This flower was found by an an old woman, named Mother Gothel, who would sing an incantation that would
          ignite its healing powers, causing her youth and beauty to be restored. She used this to live for hundreds
          of years and kept the flower hidden for only herself.<br><br>
          The king and queen of the kingdom were expecting a child, but the queen became very sick. The king sent out
          a search for the legendary magical flower, which was rumoured to possess the ability to heal. Gothel soon
          realised that they were looking for the flower, but because she is unwilling to share it with others, she
          hides it under a false shrubbery. While fleeing, however, she accidentally knocks the shrubbery and the exposed
          glow of the flower is spotted by the castle guards. they uproot the flower and take it back to the king
          who feeds it to the queen. The queen survives and gives birth to a daughter, Rapunzel, who is born with
          beautiful golden hair that glows with the magic of the flower. To honour the birth, the king and queen
          release a single floating lantern into the sky.<br><br>
          That night, Gothel sneaks into the palace an cuts a piece of Rapunzel's hair to use instead of the flower,
          however, it loses its power. To continue using its power, Gothel kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own
          daughter in a secluded tower. She has Rapunzel sing the incantation to restore her youth. Gothel raises
          Rapunzel to believe that the outside world is full of dangerous things and cruel people who would steal her
          hair and use it for their own benefit. Every year after the kidnapping, the king and queen would release
          hundreds of flying lanterns as a symbol of hope that the lost princess would return.
        </p>
        <h2>Conflict</h2>
        <p>
          The princess lives in the tower for eighteen years, occupying her time with various hobbies such as reading,
          baking, painting, candle making, and sewing. Despite all this, she finds it hard not to get bored and has a
          dream of seeing the floating lanterns in the sky which she believes are connected to her as they only appear
          on her birthday. Mother Gothel emotionall abuses and gaslights her, dismissing her wish, and harshly tells her
          to never ask to leave the tower again.<br><br>
          Mother Gothel leaves the tower and during the time she is gone, Flynn Rider, who has escaped the castle with
          the stolen princess crown, has discovered the hidden tower and climb inside thinking that it is abandoned.
          Rapunzel, however, renders him unconscious, hides him in the closet, and keeps the crown hidden from him.
          When Mother Gothel comes home again, Rapunzel tries to tell her how she is capable of defending herself in
          the outside world but is constantly emotionally abused and yelled at for considering leaving the tower.
          Rapunzel gives up and claims she'd like some more paint for her birthday instead, which would take Gothel a
          three-day trip to acquire. After Mother Gothel leaves again for the three-day journey, Rapunzel restrains
          Flynn onto a chair using her hair, wakes him up and begins interogating him about his intentions with her
          hair. When she learns that he's not after her at all, she makes a deal with him to take her to the floating
          lights and only then will she return his satchel containing the crown. He reluctantly accepts and thus begins
          their journey to see the lanterns. <br><br>
          They encounter thugs, castle guards and the Stabbington brothers whom Flynn had betrayed. In an attempt to
          outrun the brothers and the guards, Rapunzel and Flynn find themselves trapped in a cave quickly filling with
          water. In the dakrness, he tells her his real name, Eugene, and Rapunzel reveals that she has magic hair that
          glows. Remembering this, she starts to sing so her hair glows and give them enough light to escape the cave.
          They land in a riverbank, and find a place ot stay for the night where she uses her hair to heal a wound on
          Eugene's hand. <br><br>
          Meanwhile, Mother Gothel finds out that Rapunzel had escaped and begins to sarch for her. Eventually,
          she finds Rapunzel and calls her to come back. Rapunzel refuses and claims she believes Flynn likes her.
          Gothel mocks her niavety and tells her he will leave her once he gets the crown. Gothel throws the sachel
          toward Rapunzel, which she found in the tower where Rapunzel had hidden it, and goes back to join the Stabbington
          brothers with whom she formed an alliance. <br><br>
          The next morning they are found by Maximus, the horse of the captain guard, who attacks Eugene. Rapunzel convinces
          the horse to leave him alone for that one day and it reluctently agrees. The three of them head out to the
          island city the castle is on. Rapunzel gets her hair braided so no one steps on it. She has the itme of her life,
          getting things fromt he markets, reading, dancing and colouring the roads in chalk. Once nightfall hits, Rapunzel
          and Eugene hed out onto a boat to get the best view of the lights. They realise that they have feelings for
          each other at this time. Eugene has gotten two floating lights for them and Rapunzel reveals the satchel and gives it
          to him. <br><br>
          On the shore, Eugene catches sight of the brothers and brings the boat to shore to give them the satchel
          , however, he finds out that they want Rpaunzel instead so they go after Rapunzel who is waiting for Eugene. They
          tell ehr that Eugene left her on a boat and show her the boat in the water with Eugene in it. They try to kidnap her,
          and she attempts to run away but then she hears someone attack the brothers and finds Mother Gothel with a branch.
          Mother Gothel quickly takes Rapunzel home. Eugene is shown tied up and unconscious on the boat once it reaches the
          city dock and is soon arrested and taken into jail by the castle guards. Maximus hears Eugene shouting Rpaunzel's
          and gets worried. <br><br>
          Back in the tower, Rapunzel is distraught, laying in bed with the little flag Eugene had bought her with the
          sun-sahped royal crest. Suddenly. she realises that it's the same shape all over her tower walls, incorporated in all
          of her paintings. She realises she is the lost princess and that Gothel has been lying to her the whole time.
          She storms out of her room. She fights with Gothel who tries to convince her that she is delusional, however, Rapunzel
          does not back down. Gothel then decides to turn into the "bad guy".
        </p>
        <h2>Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          In the city, Maximus has called the thugs to help Eugene escape prison and take him to Rapunzel's tower. When He reaches
          there, he calls for Rapunzel to let down her hair. Her hair is let down and he climbs up into the tower but is surprised
          when he finds Rapunzel is chained up with a cloth around her mouth. Gothel comes up behind him and stabs him in the side,
          and then begins to drag Rapunzel into the basement of the tower. She tells Rapunzel to stop fighting to which Rapunzel,
          with the cloth loosened, tells her she'll never stop unless she lets her heal Eugene. Eugene cries out telling her to
          stop. Gothel agrees and chains Eugene so he doesn't follow them when she escapes with Rapunzel. Rapunzel tried to heal him
          but before she gets the chance, he cuts off all of her hair using some broken mirror on the ground. Gothel yells and
          begins to age rapidly. She tried to grab the browning hair, to no avail, and staggers around. Pascal uses some of the
          hair on the ground to make her trip and fall out of the tower. Rapunzel turns her attention back to Eugene who eventually
          becomes unconscious in her arms. She continues to sing the magical incantation and cries. A tear falls onto Eugene's cheek
          which she realises also has magical powers and heals Eugene. He wakes up and they embrace on another. <br><br>
          The film ends with the king and ueen being informed of the lost princess's return, as Eugene had brought her to her parents.
          Rapunzel and Eugene are shown waiting for the king and queen and when they arrive they all embrace in a big hug. The kingdom
          celebrates her return for an entire week, and Eugene and Rapunzel agree to get married.
          Everyone lived happily ever after.
